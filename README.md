# Systems & Application Security Projects

## Overview

This project explores **systems-level and application-level security vulnerabilities**, combining **hands-on exploitation**, **reverse engineering**, and **defensive analysis**. The work emphasizes understanding how real-world software failures arise, how they are exploited, and how modern defenses mitigate these attacks.

The repository reflects a security mindset grounded in **low-level systems knowledge, program analysis, and threat modeling**.

## Key Focus Areas

### Vulnerability Analysis & Exploitation

* Identified and exploited **memory safety vulnerabilities**, including **stack buffer overflows** and **return-address manipulation**
* Developed and analyzed **shellcode-based exploits** to understand attacker capabilities
* Evaluated the effectiveness and limitations of **modern mitigations**, such as:

  * Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
  * StackGuard
  * Non-Executable (NX) memory

---

### Reverse Engineering & Program Analysis

* Performed **binary reverse engineering** using **GDB** and **x86 assembly**
* Analyzed compiled programs to uncover:

  * Hidden logic and password checks
  * Control-flow behavior
  * Vulnerability entry points

---

### Real-World Security Threats

* Studied and analyzed **practical attack vectors**, including:

  * Malware propagation techniques
  * Web application attacks (**SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF**)
  * Authentication flaws and sandboxing weaknesses
  * Network-level security threats

* Grounded analysis in **seminal systems security research** to connect theory with practice

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Low-level systems security analysis
* Exploit development and mitigation reasoning
* Binary inspection and debugging
* Security threat modeling across software layers
* Critical evaluation of attack–defense trade-offs

---

## Repository Contents

* Lab reports and analyses covering:

  * Memory corruption vulnerabilities
  * Exploitation techniques and defenses
  * Reverse engineering exercises
  * Application and network security case studies

Each component focuses on **why vulnerabilities occur**, not just how to exploit them.

---

## Project Status

* All analyses completed and documented
* Exploits and defenses validated through controlled experiments
* No unresolved issues
